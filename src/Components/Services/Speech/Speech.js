The transcription of voice conversations, customer sentiment analysis, and subject spotting are all examples of speech and text analytics, which are used to provide meaning to otherwise unstructured data. The major use cases for this data include agent performance enhancement (e.g., lowering AHT, raising FCR, increasing sales conversion, etc.), compliance, customer happiness (e.g., NPS), and customer business intelligence. Through sentiment analysis and subject trends, speech and text analytics helps you to obtain insights from customer-agent discussions. The purpose of these insights is to better understand and serve consumers and staff by highlighting areas that need improvement, acknowledgment, and concern. In order to give comprehensive insight into customer-agent dialogues, speech and text analytics features automate voice and text analytics capabilities across 100% of encounters.",
