The transportation sector's reach and perspective are being gradually expanded by modern technology and digitization. The TTL value chain today offers services in the areas of e-ticketing, payment wallets, shared mobility, and last-mile connection, to name a few improvements and breakthroughs. The capacity to give information, services, and transportation assistance everywhere, anytime is one trend in the sector, along with the ability to purchase tickets, share rides or cabs, and manage travel statistics.  The need for effective and user-friendly end-user networks is therefore urgent. This opens up huge prospects for IT/ITeS businesses to capitalise on the demand for these services.
