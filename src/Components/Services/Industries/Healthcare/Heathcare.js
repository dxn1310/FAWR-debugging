Additionally, the Life Sciences and Healthcare industries are under intense financial strain as a result of their requirement to go digital. The Life Sciences and Healthcare industries face highly strict compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks when engaging with IT / ITeS suppliers. But during the past few years, expenditure on these has increased. The use of next-generation technology is highly widespread in the healthcare sector, which offers enormous prospects for service providers.
