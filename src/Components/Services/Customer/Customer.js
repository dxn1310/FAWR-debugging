Since every client is unique and every customer journey is unique, a single strategy frequently won't be effective for everyone. Customer segmentation is the practise of grouping your consumers according to shared traits, such behaviours or demographics, to better target them with marketing messages. ",
            content2: "All organisations, regardless of size, industry, and whether they sell online or in person, may use customer segmentation. It starts with obtaining and evaluating data and concludes with taking suitable and efficient action on the information acquired. Businesses that customise their messaging and cater to certain client segments develop 10% faster than those that don't. As your organisation expands, segments may always be made more comprehensive since they pinpoint the best clients and the locations where they are easiest to reach. Differentiation based on data from customer segmentation may help teams in marketing, sales, product development, and customer support improve their workflows.",
